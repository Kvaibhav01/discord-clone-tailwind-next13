              Hey everyone! 👋 I'm Vaibhav, a full-time freelance web developer,
              designer and blogger. I just got a lifetime membership of BuildUI
              because I really like the topics and the tech you guys cover. I
              use Tailwind, Next etc, regularly so that's a plus and I want to
              learn Framer Motion and other topics from Sam and others in this
              team.
            </p>

            Hi! Will we see future videos recorded at 4K quality? These days
            many code tutorials use 4K to offer the highest quality, right now
            this platform has 1080p which is fine and works but I think adding
            4K will be the best! 😄

          <p className='pl-14 text-gray-300'>
            I'm currently starting with Discord clone with Next.js and Tailwind
            CSS. Excited for it! 🤩
